This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy related to modifying a list while iterating using `eachWithIndex`.  The `eachWithIndex` method iterates through the list and provides both the element and its index. However, removing an element during iteration causes the subsequent indexes to be off, resulting in a potential element being skipped. The solution provides an alternative approach to achieve the intended behavior safely.
